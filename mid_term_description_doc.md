# Chem 169 Midterm: Comp Day + Process Snapshot

**Format: Bouldering competition.** Many short routes are released at once. You collect points by sending as many as you can in the time allowed. Harder routes are worth more points.

This midterm has **two components**. Together, they assess **your ability to work through problems** and **how you use AI tools while doing so**.

You are **not expected to complete everything perfectly**.
You are expected to engage seriously and make good-faith progress.

## Part 1: In-Class Comp Day (Primary Grade)

**What this is**
During class, a set of **midterm routes** will be released. You will work on them during the comp period, similar to previous climbs.

### What will be released

- **~20 short routes** covering topics from the quarter
- These are **boulder problems, not top-rope routes** — each one has 1-3 exercises, not 8
- Expected median time per route: **5-10 minutes**
- Routes have **difficulty ratings**: Easy, Medium, Hard
- You may work on **any subset** in any order

This is designed like a climbing competition: **there are more routes than anyone can finish**. Strategy matters — pick routes you're confident on, attempt harder ones for more points.

### Scoring system

Each route is worth points based on difficulty:

| Difficulty | Points per route sent |
|---|---|
| Easy | 1 point |
| Medium | 2 points |
| Hard | 3 points |

A route is **"sent"** using the same criteria as all quarter: 80%+ of exercises rated OK or better.

Partial attempts earn **partial credit** (submitted but not fully sent = some credit).

**Grade thresholds will be published before midterm day** once routes are finalized. The general idea:

- **A range**: Strong performance across multiple routes, including some medium/hard
- **B range**: Solid performance on several routes
- **C range**: Meaningful attempts on a few routes
- **D range**: Minimal engagement

> The exact point cutoffs will be shared with you before the exam. No surprises.

---

### What we expect from you

- Attempt multiple routes
- Submit notebooks with clear evidence of work
- Make progress, even if incomplete

You are **not expected** to:

- Finish every route
- Solve the hardest route
- Match anyone else's pace

---

### How to submit (Part 1)

Submit your notebooks through the same Google Form system used all quarter. One submission per route attempted. You may submit as you go — you don't have to wait until 1:50.

---

## Part 2: Process Snapshot (Lightly Graded)

**What this is**
You will submit a **copy-paste transcript** of your interaction with the AI coding assistant while working on **one** midterm route.

No video or screen recording is required.

This component is about **how you work with AI**, not whether your final answer is correct.

---

### What to submit

- A **plain-text copy** of:
  - Your prompts to the AI assistant
  - The assistant's responses
- From **one route only**
- From a **single continuous attempt**

Upload as a `.txt` or `.md` file through the submission form.

**How to copy-paste from your AI tool:**
- **Gemini (Colab sidebar)**: Select all text in the chat panel, copy, paste into a text file
- **ChatGPT**: Copy from the conversation window, or use the "Share" link
- **Claude**: Select and copy from the conversation
- Any other tool: same idea — just grab the full back-and-forth

---

### Important constraints (read carefully)

- The transcript must reflect a **real attempt**, not a reconstructed or cleaned-up version
- Do **not** submit only the "final prompt"
- Do **not** paste code written elsewhere
- You may include mistakes, dead ends, and corrections — that is expected and encouraged

You **do not** need to:

- Finish the route
- Get correct output
- Minimize confusion or errors

---

### What good process looks like (examples coming soon)

Before the midterm, we will share **video examples** showing two different styles of working with an AI assistant:

- **Style A**: Paste the problem, copy the answer, move on. Minimal interaction.
- **Style B**: Ask questions, try things, hit errors, ask follow-ups, understand what's happening, iterate.

**Style B is what we're looking for.** Watch the examples — they'll make the expectation concrete.

> Treat the AI as a collaborator, not a vending machine.

---

### One-sentence reflection (required)

Along with the transcript, include **one sentence** answering:

> *One thing I learned, changed, or realized during this attempt was:*

This sentence is short on purpose.

---

### How Part 2 is graded

This component is graded **lightly** and focuses on **process**, not outcomes.

We are looking for evidence of:

- Iterative prompting (not one-shot copy/paste)
- Follow-up questions or refinements
- Adjusting based on AI responses
- Editing, questioning, or sanity-checking suggestions

We are **not** grading:

- Correctness
- Speed
- Polished answers
- Writing style

---

## What this midterm is (and is not)

**This midterm IS:**

- A realistic test of how you work with tools
- Aligned with how we've graded routes all quarter
- Focused on engagement and reasoning

**This midterm is NOT:**

- A memorization exam
- A speed competition
- A test of hiding AI usage
- A trap based on technicalities

## FAQ

**Q: How many routes do I need to complete for an A?**
A: Exact thresholds will be published before midterm day. Generally: strong engagement across several routes, including some medium or hard ones.

**Q: Can I use any AI tool?**
A: Yes. Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, or any other AI assistant. Use whatever you're comfortable with.

**Q: What if my AI transcript is messy with errors and dead ends?**
A: Good. That's what real problem-solving looks like. We want to see your actual process, not a polished version.

**Q: Do I need to submit a transcript for every route?**
A: No. Just one route for Part 2. Pick whichever one you want.

**Q: What if I don't finish the route I'm submitting the transcript for?**
A: That's fine. We're grading the process, not the outcome.

**Q: Can I work with other students?**
A: Yes — you can discuss approaches, share tips, and help each other. That's part of the climbing culture. Your submissions (notebooks + transcript) must be your own individual work.

**Q: Is the midterm harder than regular routes?**
A: The difficulty range is similar to what you've seen. Some easy, some medium, some hard. No trick questions.

## Bottom line

- **Comp Day** shows whether you can engage productively with routes
- **Process Snapshot** helps us understand *how* you're learning with AI

If you've been working honestly and consistently all quarter, this midterm should feel familiar.
