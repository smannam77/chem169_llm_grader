**Subject:** URGENT: No Course Submissions Detected - Immediate Action Required

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I'm reaching out because our records show you haven't submitted any assignments for CHEM 169/269, including:
- **0 regular routes** submitted
- **0 midterms** submitted

This is a serious concern as we're now past the midterm deadline.

**Minimum requirements to pass:**
1. Complete a minimum number of regular routes
2. Successfully "send" at least 2 of 3 midterms (80%+ OK ratings)

If you're still enrolled and intend to continue in the course, please:
1. Check your dashboard at https://smannam77.github.io/chem169_llm_grader/
2. Contact me immediately to discuss your situation
3. Begin submitting assignments as soon as possible

If you've dropped the course or have extenuating circumstances, please let me know.

Best,
[INSTRUCTOR]
