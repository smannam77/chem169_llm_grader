**Subject:** Late Midterm Submission Not Accepted

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Your [MIDTERM_ROUTE] submission on [SUBMISSION_DATE] was received after the deadline (Feb 6, 12:15 AM) and was not among the pre-approved excused late submissions.

Unfortunately, this submission cannot count toward your midterm requirement.

**Your current status:**
- Midterms sent: [SENT_COUNT] of 2 required
- You still need: [NEEDED_COUNT] more midterm(s)

Please submit [REMAINING_OPTIONS] as soon as possible to meet the course requirement.

If you believe there were extenuating circumstances that warrant reconsideration, please reach out to discuss.

Best,
[INSTRUCTOR]
