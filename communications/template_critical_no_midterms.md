**Subject:** URGENT: Missing Midterm Submissions - Action Required

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Our records show you haven't submitted any of the 3 midterm routes (M1, M2, M3). You need to successfully complete at least 2 of 3 to pass the course.

Please check your dashboard at https://smannam77.github.io/chem169_llm_grader/ and submit as soon as possible.

If you're experiencing difficulties or have extenuating circumstances, please reach out to me immediately so we can discuss options.

Best,
[INSTRUCTOR]
